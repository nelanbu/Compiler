# Compiler

This repository contains a collection of programming assignments that cover various aspects of compiler design. The assignments are organized into different modules, each focusing on a different topic.

### Modules

**Foundations** - `Module 0:`
In this module, you will find fundamental concepts and implementations, operations over data structures including binary tree implementation, algebraic data types and prime number functions.

**Lexical Analysis and Parsing** - `Module 1:`
This module delves into lexical analysis and parsing with the following assignments:
- Recursive descent parser for a simple calculator language. 
- Lexer to tokenize input for the calculator language.

**Assembly Programming** - `Module 2:`
Converting a C program to x86 assembly language, gaining insight into assembly-level programming.

**Compiler Implementation** - `cigrid:` 
In this folder, you will find the comprehensive implementation of a compiler for a subset language of C++. The compiler includes:
- Lexer: Tokenizes the source code.
- Parser: Builds a syntax tree from the tokenized input.
- Intermediate Representations: Utilizes intermediate representations for efficient code generation.
- Abstract syntac tree: Implements the syntactic representation of the language.
- Testing: Compiles and tests the compiler with the provided subset language of C++.
